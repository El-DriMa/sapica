# Šapica 🐾

Šapica is a web-based platform created to improve and simplify the process of pet adoption. It serves as a digital bridge between animal shelters and individuals looking to adopt pets by offering a centralized, intuitive, and user-friendly environment for discovering animals in need of a home. 

The platform not only facilitates better visibility for animals waiting for adoption but also helps shelters manage their listings and interactions more efficiently. With features such as secure authentication, an admin dashboard, and an interactive map of shelters, Šapica aims to digitalize and modernize the adoption process while promoting responsible pet ownership.

## Description
Šapica is a full-stack web solution developed using Angular for the frontend and .NET Core for the backend, with MS SQL as the database. The platform enables users to explore adoptable animals, view shelter locations on an interactive map, and securely interact with the system. Administrators can manage animal listings and user data through a dedicated admin panel.

The primary goal of the application is to simplify the process of finding and adopting pets while providing shelters with a convenient way to manage and present available animals.
